# APM 5333 "Numerical Methods"
Functions based off of algorithms presented in "Numerical Analysis" (Burden et al.) for the "Numerical Methods" course I took in Fall 2021.

The code is not optimized due to the fast paced nature of the course.

Code for my APM 5334 "Applied Numerical Methods: Matrix Methods"" course for Winter 2022 can be found at https://github.com/benCd/apm_5334
